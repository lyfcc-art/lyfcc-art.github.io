<!--more-->



《World of Martial Arts Magazine》，翻译成中文为《武术世界杂志》。这本杂志创刊于2018年9月，聚焦于各种武打戏、武术电影和武术家。从“武术”两个字中，就可以感受到浓浓的男性气质。

而事实上，这本杂志在选择封面人物的时候，也一直将女性拒之于门外。这本杂志的第一期封面就是享誉世界的“成龙大哥”。而华人世界中，作为《武术世界杂志》封面主咖的则只有李连杰、甄子丹、李小龙、洪金宝几位，都是顶级的功夫巨星。凭借花木兰一角，刘亦菲称为历史上首位《武术世界杂志》的封面女星。本文将根据相关报道和采访，来尝试介绍这一决定背后的缘由。

## COLLIDER 网站对电影制作人 Jason Reed 的采访

地址: ['Mulan' Producer Jason Reed on Making a Live-Action Version That Appeals to All Audiences](https://collider.com/mulan-interview-jason-reed-casting-changes/)

制作人提到了关于选角以及电影中武打戏份的一些幕后故事。摘录如下

### 1. 关于选角

> It all starts with finding the leading lady. Disney set out on a global search to cast someone who can speak both English and Mandarin Chinese and has the physicality to take on strenuous fight scenes. In the end, the studio chose Chinese actress Yifei Liu after auditioning thousands of actresses for the role. Aside from her fierce fighting skills, Liu is known for her role as The Golden Sparrow in Forbidden Kingdom, alongside Jet Li and Jackie Chan.

选角的两个标准：1. 中英文流利 2. 打戏好。刘亦菲无疑在这两方面都是非常优秀的，被选中也算是实至名归。另外提到了《功夫之王》的`金燕子`一角，在国外颇为知名，原因即是《功夫之王》当年不管是在国内还是国外都取得了不俗的票房成绩。


### 2. 打戏相关


Context: Our conversation begins with Reed discussing an action scene being filmed during our interview.

JASON REED: 

> Yifei is just… she is unbelievable. She’s been training with us since April. She’s obviously done a lot of martial arts before and is in very good shape but she’s been working with the stunt crew. We have a very high-end athletic trainer that works with us and so she’s been working with the both of them, working every day for months and months now.

制作人介绍到，亦菲为了拍《Mulan》必须接受很多高标准的训练。她之前也拍过很多打戏并且体型非常好。


Q: Is this an action scene now?

REED:

> Yes. This is just a rehearsal. So we shot a version of this, a little wider version of this this morning with the stunt person and now this will be Yifei’s first run-through in it herself. One of the great things is -  a lot of times the stuntees come out and they do the bit and the actors come in and you go “well that’s nice” and we’ll work really hard so you look as good as the stunt people. [Yifei] is as graceful as any sort of professional athlete or any stuntee. She’s just really skilled and works really hard at it.


"亦菲的动作跟很多专业运动员或者专业人员一样优雅，她经验也很丰富，并且非常努力"


### 3. 电影延期

Context: Originally this movie when it was first *inaudible* release day, it was supposed to come out this year (2019). So what was the specifics that caused the need to be pushed back? What was taking longer than it was supposed to? 

REED:

> We waited for Yifei. Once we went through that search and we determined that Yifei was the person we wanted and that she had the correct spirit and the correct determination and work ethic. She was doing a TV show so she wouldn’t be available to a certain point. And the point when she was available, the weather was terrible for us. We had to wait, we pushed production five months which was interesting. Also the previous release date, if I’m totally honest that first release date was a placeholder anyways, and it was some ways intended to scare off anyone who wanted to make a Mulan movie. When we actually ran the real schedule for how we’d actually reach that date that was originally put in, which was March of 2019. What we would have had to do to get that date would have compromised the movie.

确定了主演是亦菲之后。因为档期的问题，为了她延期了一段时间（当时应该是在拍《一曲三笙》）。后续还有其他影响原因。

### COLLIDER 网站对于导演/亦菲的采访

也有很多跟选角和打戏相关的采访。

*Niki, is it true that you saw a thousand actresses for Mulan?*

Niki:

> Yeah, we did. We did a worldwide search, and we did a really deep search in China. A lot of us, in the casting process, had this really romantic dream that we might find Mulan in a little village in China. We didn’t. We found beautiful actresses, but when it really came down to it, we didn’t feel that we had found Mulan, so we started again. We went back to China a year after we’d started [looking], and we went through the list of everybody that wasn’t available the first time around. Yifei was one of the people on that list, and she agreed to come to Los Angeles and audition. She was so terrifyingly good as an actor, but also really super strong. The audition was very demanding. On top of her jet lag and the two hours in the dramatic audition with me, she had to go to a physical audition with a trainer because I was determined to have a young woman in this role that could understand and commit to the physical nature of the work. So, she had flown for 14 hours, she hadn’t slept all night, it was 5 o’clock the next day, and she was in the gym with a trainer who had pushed her to her limits, and she never stopped, she never asked for a break, and she did everything that was asked of her. I knew then that we’d found our Mulan, and that I’d found a partner and collaborator, and really, genuinely, a warrior.

导演和选角团队还是有一点幻想的，想着能从中国的一个小山村里找到 Mulan 的演员，跟电影一样。不过第一轮不咋幸运，没有合适的。很多演员非常漂亮，不过不适合木兰。又开始了第二轮，亦菲在这一轮中被邀请去试镜。导演觉得她非常棒，而且非常强大。亦菲当时坐了14个小时的飞机，一直没睡觉，然后就被推着开始各种体能测试，她也不喊停，一直坚持，并且圆满完成了要求的任务。这时候导演明白了，这就是她要找的木兰，一个伙伴和一个战士。


*Yifei, what did you have to do for your physical audition?*


LIU:

> I was relieved because I thought I did an okay job [at the audition], but then Niki said, “So, we’re gonna send you to this physical trainer, just to see.” I thought, “Oh, I’m on the next step. That means something.” I remember the trainer was super professional. I did push-ups, squats, weights, and different kinds of cardio, and whenever I finished one thing, he went to a notebook and wrote something. After 90 minutes, I couldn’t walk. It was more intense than the actual training process. It really tested my limits, but it was fun. It was something to remember.


菲讲述了第一轮面试之后的体能测试。差不多90min,做完之后基本上不能走路了。


*You’ve done movies that have featured heavy martial arts before, but was the training for this unlike anything else?*

LIU:

> For me, every movie is brand new and totally new to me. I have acted on some movies that have martial arts elements, but I’m not a professional. I’m so glad that I had this long time to prepare. The flexibility helped me.

菲还是不怎么详述过去的电影。她觉得自己不是专业人士，很感激电影能留出来这么多时间给我培训和准备。


*How long did you spend training and what did you have to learn?*

> For this movie, it was three and a half months. I even learned Tai Chi because I understand Mulan’s chi as her connection of her spirit, and not the ego, but her true self. So, I agreed to train that way.

大概训练了三个半月，学了太极。

### AUSTRALIAN CINEMATOGRAPHER 杂志对于电影摄影师的采访

地址: [THE AUSTRALIAN CINEMATOGRAPHER BEHIND DISNEY’S EPIC LIVE-ACTION ‘MULAN’](https://acmag.com.au/2020/06/01/mulan/)


*How did that relationship go, with director Niki Caro?*

MW:

> I think one of the most important things that the director said to me at the beginning of filming was that Mulan is the centre of the film. I always had that in the back of my mind. Whenever we talked about coverage or the choreography of the fight scenes I was always thinking that the camera had to be with her. We were lucky that Liu Yifei did many of her own stunt sequences, which meant that we could concentrate on her face. It’s not like when there’s a stunt person doing it. We could have really long lenses and focus on her face. Niki Caro is a great collaborator, so with every department the visual language was consistent and we were all very organised as a team.

拍摄时，刘亦菲都会亲自上阵完成高难度的特技动作。这样一来，摄影师就可以不用考虑以前替身演员上阵时不能拍正脸的“行规”，将镜头全部聚焦在刘亦菲身上。

## 总结

从这些采访中也能看出来，刘亦菲本身打戏很好看，几乎用不着替身。对于合作的团队来说，非常高效并且成片效果也很好。正是因为这种能力，使《武术世界杂志》决定让刘亦菲成为了它的第一个封面女郎。
